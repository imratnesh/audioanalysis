Why don't you glue your head to the TV? Don't let your food sit.
Eat it.
Get me a cable box.
I'll record it and watch later.
- Did you apply for the computer classes? - Yes.
What's the class called? What is it? Magi-Tech.
- Mom! - Look at me! Start attending those classes, or else I'll bash your head into the TV.
Got it? - Let it go.
- Why should I let it go? Does money grow on trees? Motherfucker.
Give me the phone.
- It's Mr.
Sartaj.
- Give it to me! - Let me check - Practice what you preach.
- I'm switching it off.
- Nag, nag, nag.
His car has arrived at the bungalow.
Nayanika's camera is in place.
She's waiting for Bunty.
He's there.
He's sitting next to her.
Do they bring your food on time on set? Everyone on set was talking about Gaitonde.
Your friend? My friend? Who told you that? Did I ever say Gaitonde was my friend? - Did I? - No.
- I didn't, right? - No.
Then who told you? Tell me! Ma'am, what's happening? I asked you a question, didn't I? Who told you?! Who asked you about him?! Do you go to the set to work or to gossip? What's happening? Tell me! Who told you? Who told you? Fucking - Get out of there.
- What's happening in there? Motherfucker! He's seen the camera! Get out! Mr.
Sartaj Singh.
Weren't you the last person to see Gaitonde alive? He had such shitty luck.
Anything in his pockets? Destroy it.
Anything else? - Keep this.
- Okay.
Return this when he leaves.
It'll be useful on traffic duty.
- What's this? - I also found this.
Don't eat this shit.
Your manhood will shrink from this to this.
Really? Then I'll have to beat women to feel like a man.
Are you a man? Let me see.
You are Superman, right? Show me.
Why did Gaitonde come back? What will happen in 25 days? Straight from Sonu, the pickpocket, to Gaitonde.
What crazy luck you have.
Anjali Mathur.
She's a senior officer from Delhi.
So? Do you want me to marry her? She'll talk to you.
It's for your own good.
Don't get sucked into this.
I'm getting out.
After tonight, I'll be far away from this shit.
Got it? Now, fuck off.
She's coming with me.
She's not.
She's going away.
Far, far away.
Take him away.
Be respectful.
Treat him well.
He's come here for the first time.
- Move! - Treat him extremely well.
Let's go.
Stop! Get out! Give me your phone.
Where are you? With the target, in Wadala.
Near Bhakti Park Station.
He's stopped here.
Take me to Wadala.
He's going to kill the girl.
Two trucks have stopped.
The trucks are following his car.
He put the girl in a different car.
Follow the target, I'll look for the girl.
She's my informer.
I promised to protect her.
I'll follow the girl.
Send me the license number.
Fuck! Where's my money? Fuck you, Katekar.
Got it.
Yes.
What about the rest? Interpol and RAW are out to fuck us.
It will be difficult to get you out of the country.
Didn't you promise me that you'd get me out of the country before June 17th if I give you the stuff? - Yes, we still have 20 days.
- Really? You think Bunty's an idiot? Do I look like a dickhead to you? I'm in this because of Gaitonde.
I have nothing to gain here.
- I have nothing to do with your shit.
- Kishore, start loading the stuff.
Hey! I'm not done talking! I'll deal with you later, motherfucker.
I'll shove an umbrella up your ass and open it.
I'm warning you.
Got it? Let's go.
What should we do with him, sir? He's a cop.
Burn his clothes and body separately.
Rajiv Gandhi did the same thing.
He dealt with Shah Bano and the country separately.
In 1986, Shah Bano's husband divorced her.
She took him to court and won the case.
But our former PM, Rajiv Gandhi, a pussy, overturned the court's judgment and threw Shah Bano to the mullahs.
The Hindus criticized him for this.
He had the Ramayan show aired on TV to please them.
Every Sunday morning, the entire country was glued to the TV.
Bunty was no exception.
Bunty understood that religion could open many doors.
The prime minister's trick worked wonders.
Until your motherland is taken back from those pigs You motherfucker, give me back my cassette! Give it back! Motherfucker! - Why the fuck are you breaking it?! - Shut up, motherfucker! What were you listening to? Talk about destroying mosques, motherfucker? Have you lost it? Thinking of destroying mosques? I will listen to whatever the fuck I want! I don't need your permission! - Show me what you can do! You dickhead! - Wait, I'll show you.
Your sister is waiting for me.
Fuck you, you cunt! You asshole! Fucking cunt! You motherfucker! What are you doing?! Fuck around in here again and next time it'll be boiling oil! Why are you into these Muslim guys? Does he even get an erection? Keep working, motherfucker.
He sticks it in deeper than you ever could.
You bitch, I swear Forget it.
Stupid bitch.
I'll kill you and that Muslim guy.
Fuck off.
- You fucking whore.
I'll - Bunty! Come here.
She's your sister.
Chotta Badriya loves her.
He'll give her a home and respect.
She'll be happy.
She's already happy, and she has a home too.
All you do is beat her up.
Do you like beating women? Fuck all of you.
Women are goddesses! No.
Why won't you let me turn you over? If you want to experience my magic, you can, but only on my terms.
Does Isa kiss men in front of everyone? - That's how they greet each other.
- But he didn't say "hello.
" That's how they say hello.
I want that car.
Ask me and you'll get it all.
What is your magic all about? Never ask a magician to reveal her secrets.
Sir.
I went to the temple.
I've brought the offerings for you.
How about this? Please have some, sir.
Is this also the goddess' offerings? No, sir.
It's an advance.
Bipin is contesting the election in Morwad.
- Will he win? - Yes, sir.
It's dominated by Marathi-speaking people.
There are a few from Gujarat and Marwar, but they're all Hindus.
Why has he come here? The Lalgarh area in Gopalmath.
That slum is Won't they vote for him? No.
Sir, how will I get Muslim votes? What do you want from me? If the Muslims don't vote, we'll win.
I told you that I don't want to get into this Hindu-Muslim shit.
Come here.
This is Badriya.
He's a Muslim.
We're friends.
That's Bunty a Hindu devotee.
We're all friends.
Gaston and Pascal as well.
And there's the Parsi guy.
He's my cook.
I may be a bad guy but I'm not like you.
So don't come back here Bipin Bhonsle.
Mr.
Bhonsle.
Mr.
Bhonsle! Mr.
Bhonsle! Mr.
Bhonsle.
Mr.
Bhonsle, I'm Bunty.
I helped your father buy a piece of land.
I fought the union guys.
Took it right from under Faruk Chand's builder's nose.
Deepak Shinde? I broke Faruk Chand's hand with a steel pipe.
You talk too much.
What do you want? Sir, this is your first election.
You came to Mr.
Gaitonde for help.
If you win, you'll make me one of your aides, right? He doesn't give a fuck about the election.
Sir, he's a businessman.
He'll help you for the right price.
Mr.
Bhonsle.
Asshole! Who the fuck are you to negotiate for me? Boss there won't be any issues.
You have Kukoo.
You have her magic.
- Gaitonde, hear him out.
- Shove that offer up your ass.
Boss, 50 lakh rupees.
Democracy is worth 50 lakh rupees.
Boss, that's the same price as Isa's car.
Who says Kukoo's magic doesn't work? Rolls-Royce, baby.
Is it real, baby? I hated Bhonsle, but doing business with him taught me a valuable lesson.
Guns, drugs, real estate, all of those were small-time.
The real business was politics.
Even before India became a country, people have been using religion to sway political decisions.
When I got involved with Bhonsle, the mafia became integral to religion and politics.
A new era began in India.
The game wasn't between Gaitonde and Isa anymore.
It was between the Hindus and the Muslims.
Have faith in us.
I'll take care of everything.
Gaitonde! Come out! Long live India, sir.
I told you to give me a daily update.
Not much has happened.
I want Bunty.
Get him before anyone else does.
- Other agencies are also involved.
- They're not based in Mumbai.
You are.
My wife turned my phone off.
Wives They were emptying water from the tanks and filling them with something else.
- What was it? - I don't know.
Who was the other guy? He didn't look Indian.
- Was he a foreigner? - Maybe.
Bunty will be out of the country by the 16th.
That's when the 25 days will end.
Where is Nayanika? Markand, I have a lead.
Was it here? Fuck! Are you a man or a horse? Bunty's gone.
Isn't he the reason we're here? Don't you understand? She'll just use you, then throw you away.
They call it collateral damage.
You've created an elaborate theory based on a local cop's word.
Move aside, fucker.
The cripple has called me.
Brother, staying away from your holy presence - Did you find out about Gaston and Pascal? - No.
The police came looking for you.
They've arrested two of my waiters.
I'm shitting myself here and you're worried about your waiters.
- How will I get out of here? - Did I tell you to get stuck in this? You're getting old.
- Control your temper.
- Shut up.
- Get to the point.
- Serve the food! What do you think? It doesn't make any difference now.
Understand? I'm asking you something! Look at me! Talk to me! Eat, or else I'll shove it up your ass! You think you're a goddess? If you're a goddess, then I'm a demon! A demon! What are you gonna do? You think you can hit me? You cunt.
Sit! Sit there! Everyone is looking for me because of you! I won't tolerate this anymore.
Got it? What are you looking at? I told you to serve me food, didn't I? Does this look like a show to you? Call Shivaji.
Shivaji.
Come here.
What's the name of that whore from RAW? Anjali Mathur.
Get her number.
He called me out of the blue after ten years.
He asked me for a favor.
I do as he says.
Who's killing Gaitonde's men? Why do you want to leave the country? What's going to happen on the 16th? Ma'am, don't you know how deals work? - What's in it for me? - What do you want? I'll tell you everything.
Just get me out of here.
Out of this country.
Yes, I knew how they have fucked you over for 20 years.
Sometimes, I feel like I am God.
It's my story.
Everyone else is playing their part in it.
And I connect them together.
Bunty.
Where is Bunty? Check inside your asshole.
- Listen.
- Yes, sir.
I want Sartaj.
- Today.
Right now.
- Yes, sir.
I don't know how this world came into existence, but I do know how it will come to an end.
Okay, all right.
Move back, move back.
It's a gruesome murder.
Must have been an expensive watch.
Expensive enough to get him killed.
Any witnesses? None.
Sir, it's time for your hearing.
Parulkar will be pissed if you're late.
Just say what Parulkar wants you to.
Junaid had a weapon.
A homemade gun.
We warned him to surrender.
But he responded by firing at Constable Raut.
Constable Raut was shot and he fell down.
The boy tried to run away, and Mr.
Parulkar went after him.
We had the area sealed.
He couldn't have escaped.
He pointed the revolver at Mr.
Parulkar.
Mr.
Parulkar immediately warned him to put it down, but Junaid was going to pull the trigger.
Before he could fire Sir, before he could fire, Mr.
Parulkar fired three rounds at him.
What the fuck were you doing? Did you forget what we told you? Tell me.
- Are you going to turn us all in? - What's happening? Majid? He was an 18-year-old kid.
Is there an age limit to become a terrorist? We could have arrested him.
Is he new here? He was surrendering.
There's so much filth in this city, Sartaj.
- We can't always follow procedure - Can you say that to his father? Have you ever solved a case? Do you want to be the next Ramakant Jadhav? - Google him, he tried to testify too.
- Majid Go see a doctor.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Don't come.
Tomorrow's report will state that you killed Junaid.
Then what? It's a good thing Megha left you.
He plays tennis.
Ever played tennis? Ms.
Megha is looking at us.
Shall we go? I won't ever forget Neither will I Once Dad decided to take us to the Golden Temple.
It was a big deal for us.
- Visiting Amritsar - Is the Golden Temple made of gold? Listen.
The day we had to leave Dad was summoned to the police station.
There had been an accident.
A car had run over a beggar kid.
Someone had to go to the hospital.
Anyone could have gone.
But Dad canceled the trip to Amritsar.
I cried for days.
I stole a 10-rupee bill from Dad's wallet and burned it.
Back in 1990.
Mom slapped me later.
You know what my dad said? "I was meant to go and see that kid.
" I wanted to be like my dad.
A good policeman.
Sir, you worry a lot.
Parulkar has the Inquiry Commission in his pocket.
It doesn't matter what you do or say at this point.
I was in the street blocking the exit.
He came running towards me unarmed.
- He was in his late teens.
- Sir - He started crying when he saw me.
- Sir Sir, save me! Parulkar came from the other side.
He's surrendering, sir! I yelled out that he was surrendering but he shot him.
Sir, everything will be fine once you solve a big case.
How will that happen? In the last ten years, all I've managed to do is catch Sonu, a pickpocket.
Sir, do you believe in God? Who is this? Speak up, motherfucker.
Who is this? I want to tell you a story.
Go ahead.
- Who was it? - I don't know.
Some asshole.
Should I trace the number? Fuck! Forget about God.
Do you believe in magic? Sometimes, I feel like my life is magical.
Are you crazy? Why did you end up in the police force? You wanted to be like Gavaskar, but you're handling Tendulkar's security.
Who is this? You have to save your city.
I heard you love this city.
Who is this? An old friend of Dilbagh Singh.
How do you know my father? Listen.
Your destiny will change.
- You'll change my destiny? - We'll change each other's.
How? If you tell them who called they'll forget about Sonu, the pickpocket.
Are you one of Ravi Pandit's guys? Ravi Pandit is a little shit.
I wouldn't fuck with your sleep for that nobody.
Stop bullshitting.
Who are you? Do you have a lead or not? They're going to kill me.
I can't trust anyone in this city.
Then I remembered Dilbagh Singh.
Who's going to kill you? How do you know Dilbagh Singh? Mr.
Sartaj, how I know him is not that easy to explain.
When I was 10 or 11 years old this day was decided.
This very moment our connection you, Dilbagh Singh and I.
I could see my destiny in the water.
Ever since I was a kid, I've felt like my life was a story from the scriptures.
Like the whole world, including my father, was a part of my story.
The drought lasted for a thousand years before Sage Gautama meditated and manifested the River Ganges.
In my village, the Ganges was known as the Godavari.
My father was a priest there, but he was nothing more than a beggar.
Please help me.
Ma'am, help me.
Dad, is God everywhere? Of course.
He's everywhere.
He's in every grain of rice in this bag.
But he doesn't beg.
My father's weakness disgusted me.
That's when I decided that I would be the master of my fate.
Sir, the DOT is tracing the number.
He's somewhere near the Metro Theater.
Tell me more.
My mother she was very affectionate.
I don't know how my dad found her.
Come here.
When it was dark she was the light in our lives.
How is it? Beautiful, right? She always made herself beautiful for that beggar.
Mom.
Mom, where did you get this from? I knew this dream wouldn't last.
While my beggar father slept, my mother stayed awake and she slept while he was awake.
She was only truly alive when he was gone.
Her world would come alive then.
What are you doing? Are you crazy? Ganesh is sleeping.
So what? I want to sleep with you.
Come back when Ganesh is at school.
There's no school tomorrow.
It's Sunday.
I want to do it now.
What are you doing? What if he wakes up? Let him wake up.
You're going to hit me? You son of a bitch! Do you have the courage? You fucker! Watch your mouth or I'll hit you.
Some of my childhood memories are still fresh.
Why are you crying? Because I tore your shirt? Your whore of a mother can buy you a new shirt every day.
And some of it feels like it never happened.
Like it was a part of my past life.
It feels like yesterday when I was running madly.
From the fields, from my home, from the Godavari, from my father's chanting, and from his God.
And it feels like a lifetime since I saw my mother.
What is religion? The mother or the father? Whatever it is, I was free of it now.
I needed a new religion.
Bombay.
What is it, sir? Are you trying to find me? Why would I be looking for you? I'm hungry.
I want eggs.
Should I get you a chicken? Yes, I'm at the Metro Circle.
Do you know the name of the building? Sir, he's somewhere close by.
The next street has the best Anda Pav.
Opposite Kyani.
I'm right there.
Come, let's eat together.
You'll find Sunil there.
Tell him I say hi.
He chops onions really fast.
Are you fucking around with a signal scrambler? I have a story to tell, so I need your time.
- So I took you for a ride.
- I heard your story.
Your mom was a whore and your dad was an asshole.
Watch your mouth, sir.
- Do you know who I am? - A small-time thug with a small dick and no balls.
Call a doctor and stop fucking around with me.
RCN number 215578, 18th December, 2006.
My first case, IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.
Look at the records to know if I am a man or a god.
RCN number 215578, 18th December, 2006.
My first case, IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.
My first case, IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.
Look at the records to know Fuck, we're screwed! Greetings.
I am speaking from Balochistan.
There's word that a faction of ISI has gone rogue and is smuggling fake currency into India.
They are planning something disastrous against India with Hizbuddin's support.
I'm asking you to send help.
If you can get some Indian support for our freedom, I can give you some names.
Sir, we're closed.
I told you that I spoke to Mr.
Parulkar.
Come back in the morning.
I need to enter it in the register.
It's an unusual situation.
You'll get a letter from the DCP's office tomorrow.
Did you hear that? He mentioned Kailashpada Police Station.
Did you hear that? He's been missing for 17 years.
He hasn't been in India for 23 years.
It can't be him.
He has 158 murder cases against him.
He fucked both RAW and ISI before disappearing.
- Where are the classified files? - In that corner.
Row number 30.
He must be crazy to come back.
- Where are you going? - I'm going to hell.
"Ganesh Eknath Gaitonde.
" Are you frightened? What will you do now, Mr.
Sartaj? Why did you call me? How can I tell you if you won't listen? Where have you been for the past 15 years? Singapore? Malaysia? Right here in Zone 13.
Sir, it's a trap.
Call for backup.
How will that help me? I'll be back to doing the same old shit.
Parulkar and Majid will be pissed.
Fuck Majid.
- How far is it from there? - Twenty minutes.
That's some speed.
Are you in love with Bombay now? We live like cockroaches.
What's there to love? Try going out at night.
If I didn't love this city I wouldn't have built my empire here in the garbage dumps.
This is what Bombay is now.
An empire amongst garbage dumps.
That's the beauty of this city, sir.
Anything is possible.
In 1977, Indira Gandhi's Emergency reigned over the country.
The government was sterilizing its people.
But Bombay Bombay didn't slow down.
Everybody found work here.
I benefited from being a Brahmin's son.
SATYANARAYAN SHUKLA UPPER-CASTE HINDU HOTEL - PURE VEGETARIAN Shukla Seth, Hindu Hotel.
A regular meal for 8 rupees, a deluxe meal for 12 rupees.
Hurry up! They used baking soda in the rice and fake ghee in the dal.
Why are you touching the rice with your dirty hands? This is the Hindu Hotel! People don't come here because we serve good food.
They come because everything here is clean and pure.
Everyone from the cook to the waiter belongs to the upper caste.
Religion found business in purity.
I made sin a business.
Bombay had a booming market for drugs.
I wanted to dig in.
Mandrax.
One pill costs 10 rupees.
Two for you and eight for Mathu.
Don't lick it, swallow it.
Okay.
Mandrax gives you the ultimate kick.
The craving for it will grow with every passing day.
It's the best business.
Mathu taught me how to sell.
If the guy had red eyes and dark circles, he would definitely buy Mandrax.
I could have been high on Mandrax, or under a spell.
Shukla Seth beat me black and blue, but I felt no pain.
Bastard! Son of a whore! I told you, no bullshit here.
Ever since then, I've known that I am Ashwathama.
I'm immortal.
Sir, you haven't given me my salary.
You don't do any work, and then you ask for a salary? Work for three more months.
I haven't gotten anything for two months, sir.
You will.
My dickhead boss owned a scooter, but he drove it like it was Isa's red car.
I'll tell you about Isa later.
I fantasized about his red car.
I wanted it.
- Eat.
- Mathu told me to be brave.
Being brave meant becoming a sinner.
Don't think so much.
Think of it as a vegetable, not a dead bird.
Rip it and eat it like a jackfruit.
Try it.
A chicken bone in a Hindu hotel can cause more damage than any gangster.
It's been happening since pre-independence days.
To create a rift amongst the Muslims, dump pork in a mosque.
To incite riots amongst the Hindus, dump beef in a temple.
And for a devout Hindu, a bone was enough.
From the Hindu Hotel I learned how religion can fuck anyone over.
I had much more to learn.
I had to meet Mathu's boss, Salim Kaka.
Salim Kaka.
An Afghan bull, the king of gold smuggling.
My second father.
Are you done? Now give me the tip.
Close your eyes and chant "I am Lord Brahma.
" What? I am the alpha and the omega.
Everything will become clear.
Your thoughts will turn into reality.
If God wasn't real, how would we have conceived the idea of him? God talks to us through stories.
Our lives are the stories.
Someone is monitoring the call.
What? You have 25 days to save your city.
Twenty-five days? What will happen in 25 days? - Where are you? - I don't know, sir.
I'm almost there.
- Sorry, sir.
- Don't hang up! Fuck! It's auto-erasing from a remote server.
- I don't think we'll get anything.
- We have this, right? I don't know what it is.
Listen, was there ever a garbage dump in Zone 13? Garbage? - Yes - He said There was one, sir.
A long time ago.
Around 25, 30 years ago.
There's a mall there now.
DMD Mall.
You can try using dynamite, but this door won't open.
Save your city, Mr.
Sartaj.
Sit on the chair.
Eager to nab me, aren't you? - What will happen in 25 days? - Everyone is going to die in 25 days.
Only Trivedi will be safe.
Who's Trivedi? An asshole.
Fuck him.
Why will he be safe? My father is going to fuck everyone, but I'll save Trivedi.
Which father? The village priest? No, sir.
I have three fathers.
All three of them fucked me up.
The first one instilled fear in me, the second gave me guts.
The last one, the one I loved the most, betrayed me.
How? The first father was a priest.
I didn't want to be like him.
The second father, Salim Kaka, whose eyes told me, "Gaitonde, if you kill me, you'll become immortal.
You are Ashwathama!" Hop on.
Sit down.
Don't utter a word.
I told you not to do it.
Salim Kaka was also known as the ball-breaker.
He'd squeeze the balls so hard that the brain would burst and the person would be dead in minutes.
Salim Kaka had done this 14 times.
Mathu was petrified.
So was I, but I had made up my mind.
You want to be brave, go ahead.
I won't.
You told me to be brave.
This box has so much money, you'll never have to sell Mandrax again.
Do you even know what being brave means? Those six assholes over there know what it means.
But will they do it? You're out of your mind.
Put it down.
It's empty now, but it has killed two people.
Keep it safe.
It's done.
Salim Kaka may have been a smuggler, but he was actually a demon.
My conscience told me to free this fucker's soul.
We had learned the tricks of smuggling gold.
Now Salim Kaka was of no use to us.
You! Motherfucker! Why did you throw it, motherfucker? Hit this motherfucker! Motherfucker! Enough! Enough! Stop it, he's dead! Everyone was scared.
They looked at Salim Kaka's corpse with utter disbelief.
No one said anything to me.
No one shot me.
No one praised me.
Does this happen to you? When you kill someone, you visualize yourself as that person.
I've seen myself in every person I have killed.
Gaitonde, open the door! Your game will be over soon.
Don't do this, sir.
My mind has never been so fucked up, and I have more to tell.
We'll listen to the rest of it in jail.
There will be nothing left in 25 days.
Come on! - Harder! - Harder! Raise the shovel and hit it! Dilbagh Singh introduced me to my third father.
Go! - What? - I called you up to return his favor.
Who did my father introduce you to? When? Gaitonde! What did you say? Come with me peacefully.
Who did Dilbagh Singh introduce you to? Put the gun down! It's not over yet, Mr.
Sartaj.
I told you, I am Ashwathama.
I won't die.
I'm not going anywhere till the game is over.
Come on, Mr.
Sartaj.
Now we'll be together when it destroys us.
Holy shit! Do you believe in God? 
Sartaj, where are you? Get out of there.
Don't fuck around.
Get ahold of yourself, or you'll end up in the small arms unit.
You can sit and clean revolvers for a month.
Sir, this is the same guy.
Malcolm Mourad.
He was with the GIA in Algeria.
Then he disappeared for 12 years.
He was seen in Peshawar five years ago.
Germany detained him for two years for making dirty bombs.
First Gaitonde, and now Malcolm Mourad is in India.
Whose number do you need, sir? Zoya Mirza's.
- Did you find anything? - No.
Check the calls she made this afternoon.
She must have called Parulkar at around 2:30 p.
m.
Is this the one? No.
Show me Parulkar's call records.
Parulkar's? Yes, Parulkar's.
The file that Jojo had is now with me.
It contains everything, from Gaitonde to Pakistan.
Tell me when you want to meet.
What do you want, Inspector? How do you know Gaitonde? He produced my first movie.
Did he pay for your surgery? Only my acting fees.
When was the last time you saw him? You must have made copies of this file.
Now you can blackmail me forever.
Blackmailers don't talk face-to-face.
When did you last see him? A week before he died.
Where? I don't know.
It was dark.
He took me somewhere.
What did you talk about? He asked if I had betrayed him too.
Betrayed how? I don't know.
He was acting strange.
He seemed depressed, or maybe he was scared.
Who was Gaitonde scared of? - I don't know.
- Did he talk about an attack on Mumbai? Or about a consignment that was on the way? He told me to leave Mumbai.
- Why? - I just told you! He was saying weird strange things.
"Everyone will die except Trivedi.
" Do you know Trivedi? Have some news for you.
Trivedi.
Celibate since birth.
A bureaucrat who drank five glasses of milk every day.
He dreamed of changing the country's future.
Nobody knew much about him.
He was my third father's follower.
He would touch his feet and seek blessings.
Bless me, Guruji.
It's time you stopped with all this deference.
What can be done? Old habits die hard.
What time of year is it? - It's the monsoon season - No, no, the date.
August 10th, 1992.
The wheel is turning.
Only 25 years are left.
The times will change.
Twenty five years? - But, Guruji, I thought - Mr.
Trivedi for the universe, 25 years go by in the blink of an eye.
That's it.
Revolution will come when we have our people - on foreign lands too.
- Yes, Guruji.
Did you find anyone? That's why I am here.
I have someone in mind.
Sir, this is our staff.
We've reserved the hotel just for you.
This way, sir.
Eat.
Are you fasting? - No.
- Then eat.
Why are you picking at your food? Come on, eat.
Eat.
This is kharvas.
Try it.
It's made from a cow's colostrum.
You can taste the sacrifice in it.
- Have some.
- Okay.
Try some for me.
I won't eat either.
Here is your bow and arrow! You're not on the battlefield.
- Hey, Bhonsle.
- Mr.
Ganesh.
Welcome.
Please take a seat, ma'am.
Hey, get some chairs.
Please come.
Mr.
Trivedi? This is Ganesh Ganesh Gaitonde.
- Ganesh! - Mr.
Ganesh.
Ganesh the way you radiate power and strength it feels like Lord Shiva has been reborn.
Only once in a lifetime does God manifest himself like this.
I'm sure he gives you a heads-up before coming.
Sir, he has a strong connection with God.
He's a famed scholar.
- No.
- A man of extraordinary devotion.
He performs holy rituals.
Very impressive.
- No - Listen, Bhonsle.
- I have a lot to do in very little time.
- Yes.
Let's skip the small talk.
That's not up to you.
It's all predestined.
What do you want? Your support.
To help our people grow.
To spread our wings.
- "Our," as in? - Well, our community.
We are just servants.
Bhonsle, I don't get him.
- You talk in riddles.
- Yes.
I prefer to keep things simple.
Okay.
Let's get straight to business.
Look, it's a big job.
And it's a huge responsibility.
It's time to go overseas.
India is going to turn into a battlefield.
And we need a general.
- Two things, Mr.
Trivedi.
- Yes? First, Bombay gave me all I have.
I'll never leave it.
And second, imagine two ducks in front of a duck, and two ducks behind a duck.
Tell me, how many are there in total? Well, how many? It's simple.
There are three ducks.
If you talk in riddles, I'll shove all three ducks up your ass.
You'll be eating and shitting from the same hole.
- I'll be off now.
- Ganesh - Such a waste of time.
- Ganesh - He's an important man.
- So am I.
- Sir Let her eat.
- Come on! - Let her eat the jalebis.
- Just pack them up.
- Hail Lord Rama! - Hail Lord Rama! You ate so many jalebis.
- What? - How many did you eat? Tell me.
Twelve.
Gopalmath's mosquitoes are going to get diabetes tonight.
Tell me something.
If you're so fond of sweets why didn't you eat the kharvas? Well when I was young, we would get kharvas for the Lord Ganesha festival.
I could smell it the moment it entered the house.
We were not allowed to eat it.
It was only for God.
But I would devour it in my dreams.
I'd imagine its heavenly taste.
It was perfect.
That's why I didn't eat it.
I thought it wouldn't live up to the kharvas of my dreams.
Trivedi asked me to leave India but my heart was in Bombay.
Yet my Bombay was about to change.
"In 25 years, everything will change.
" That is what my third father said.
And with the fall of the Babri Mosque, the 25-year-cycle began.
Lord Rama was born there.
That's what the priests said.
Babur built a mosque on it 465 years ago.
The plan was to demolish it and build a temple instead.
The Hindu-Muslim riots began.
To avenge the demolition, Isa bombed Bombay.
The whole city turned into a graveyard.
The people of Gopalmath needed me.
I don't need your money! Go buy your men some balls instead.
Tell them to kill ten Muslims for every Hindu killed! Look! My son's legs are broken! Look! Look! He lost his legs in the bomb blast.
What can I do? I'm not God.
I can't give him his limbs back.
People are coming from all over Bombay to meet you and you're sitting here in Gopalmath.
- There must be a reason - What reason? They are all shit-scared.
Cowards.
Only the weak need God.
Being weak is not a crime.
Religion is the biggest business in the world.
They use the fear of God to rule over people.
The poor don't fear God.
They love him.
He gives them strength.
This business that you speak of, it's only for the rich and powerful.
All the poor do is struggle.
They wash people's cars, houses and toilets.
They're only welcomed at the temples.
They play loud music and dance during the festivals, not to please God but to enjoy their one day of freedom.
They're not allowed inside dance clubs, so they make the city their dance floor.
They feel like they belong here, like they're equals.
They feel like they're not fuckwits, they're humans.
Where's Gaitonde? Wait, wait.
Which police station are you from? - Hey! - Wait.
Where's Gaitonde? Call him.
He's not here.
Cover him.
Motherfucker! Bunty! Bunty! They weren't cops.
Who were they? That motherfucker Isa's men, boss! Okay.
Both of my legs are gone, boss.
Subhadra.
Subhadra.
What did Lord Rama do when Ravana abducted Sita? - He sent Hanuman.
- Yes.
He sent Hanuman, right? And then Hanuman set Lanka on fire.
Then what did Lord Rama do? He killed Ravana.
Yes.
When Isa killed Subhadra, he awoke the Hindu in me.
Isa left for Dubai after the bombings.
His business was done here, but he took his revenge before he left.
It was my turn now.
Subhadra was innocent.
So I chose the innocent and killed them.
Isa had nothing to do with them, but I killed them anyway.
The people of Gopalmath had been demanding revenge on the Muslims for a long time, but my vengeance was only for Subhadra.
All of Isa's men have been killed.
Abdul, Langur, that motherfucker Ghaslet's brothers, Moinuddin, Bajil, Zia, all of them.
Is that all, fucker? Boss? Burn down the entire slum.
No one should be able to escape.
Let those bastards burn in their own hell.
Motherfuckers.
Okay, boss.
Let's go.
Motherfuckers.
But people thought I had avenged all of them.
By taking innocent lives, I became their god.
But Subhadra was gone forever.
To avenge her murder, I killed 80 Muslims in one night.
But she wasn't coming back.
No one had ever done this in Bombay.
I knew the cops would come for me.
Please place the flowers here.
We will complete the ritual now.
Your hand Back then, I had no idea that Trivedi was involved in this mess.
But the very first time I saw his face, I knew this man was a dog.
Anything goes wrong this time and I'm out.
Did you understand? Would you like anything? One black tea, please.
Why did you do this? Do you know the motto of the Mumbai Police? Sadrakshanay Khalnigranay.
Protect the law, destroy evil.
Nayanika She did not get justice.
It was my fault.
My stupidity.
I should have told you.
Do you know what our motto is? We protect those who protect the law.
So our mottos are similar.
What's the latest intel? Jojo Mascarenhas used to send Zoya Mirza to Gaitonde.
Gaitonde made her a movie star.
She saw one guy meeting Gaitonde frequently.
Safari suit, bureaucratic type.
He got Zoya's fake passport made with just one call to the embassy.
Some IFS type.
Trivedi.
Did she specifically say "IFS"? She said "IFS type.
" She wasn't sure.
- What did he talk to Gaitonde about? - They never spoke in front of her.
They ran a company together.
Blue Global.
An NGO.
It must be a shell company.
It's been in the news lately.
It sends water tankers to drought-hit areas.
Could those be the tankers Malcolm was emptying at the warehouse? They have to be.
This place is filled with trash.
Why did you run? Why is this place shut? We were told that the work was done.
We work on a project basis.
We're done for this year.
What project? Are these your company balance sheets? - Yes.
- What? Yes.
Where are the tankers? They've gone to the home minister's drought-relief program.
It's all official.
You can't do this.
What do the tankers carry? It's not watermelon juice, obviously.
It's water.
- Water? - Why are you hitting me? Why don't you go check? Where would we do that? Where? Something's fishy.
- What? - The NGO is pretty old, but there's been no funding for the last 10-12 years.
Before that, the funds came from the Czech Republic for three years, from Egypt for two years, and from Uganda for three years.
Hello? Yes, Sandeep, listen.
Make a list of all the IFS postings from 1996 to 2006, and see if there's a guy called Trivedi in there.
Hey, Parulkar, what is your inspector doing? - What is he up to? - What happened, sir? I'll tell you what happened! He came to my NGO and hit the manager.
What was he doing there? - I'll look into it.
- Get looking! We'll parade you naked around the city, bastard! Sartaj, where are you? I'm doing my job, sir.
I suggest you do the same.
Earn some good karma.
Look over there.
Shit.
Get up! - Let's go.
- Get them! Sartaj, give me the gun! - The gun! Give it to me! - They'll kill you! Move back! Move back! I said, move back! Life has taught me one thing.
When you think you're headed to heaven you often end up in hell.
Do you want to die, asshole? You're not scared? That name on your tag Dwivedi.
Oh, you're finally done jerking off.
Keep your men in check.
Bastard! Tie him up.
Have you lost it? Think this over.
- Hey! - Come on! Mr.
Parulkar, have you been sleeping with Isa? Did he bathe you spray you with perfume, and send you here? I'd never felt so lonely in my life.
But in that hell, our fates were bound together like iron and a magnet, Sartaj.
While all those bastards tortured me, a kind man offered me water.
A messenger of God in the kingdom of Satan.
Your father, Dilbagh Singh.
Get inside or I'll shoot you.
Get inside! Get inside! No, ma'am Tell me.
I found a guy who was in the Czech Republic for three years, in Egypt for two, and - Trivedi? - No, Sharma.
It's the same guy.
- Where is he? - In Mumbai.
- Mumbai? - Yes.
